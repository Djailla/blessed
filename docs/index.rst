Blessed API Reference

Read The Readme First
=====================

This is the API documentation for the Blessed terminal library. Because
Blessed uses quite a bit of dynamism, you should `read the readme first`_, as
not all the useful stuff shows up in these autogenerated docs.

However, if you're looking for seldom-used keyword args or a peek at the
internals, you're in the right place.
